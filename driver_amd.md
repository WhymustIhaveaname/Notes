    AMD's official driver is always unstable, so we need to install an opensorce one

    ```
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
        # and then apt update & apt upgrade
    ```

    * The Open Source AMD Radeon Ubuntu Driver is already installed on your system by default. Theyâ€™re integrated into Mesa and the Linux kernel.
    (comment: the `mesa` is the same as [3]. However, my ubuntu 20.04 does not have it out of box.)
    * `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers` and then `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade` (also same as [3])
